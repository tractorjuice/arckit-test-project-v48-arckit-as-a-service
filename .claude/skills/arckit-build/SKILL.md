description: "This skill should be used when the user asks to bulk-build ArcKit artefacts, run an end-to-end architecture build, generate multiple /arckit:* outputs in parallel, orchestrate a wave-based build, resume an interrupted build, or rebuild a project from scratch without exhausting main-context. Triggers: arckit-build, build harness, build all artefacts, generate full project, /arckit:* in parallel, run the recipe, --plan, --resume, --target, --refresh, --recipe, state.json. The skill orchestrates parallel /arckit:* generation using subagent isolation: reads project state, computes the artefact dependency DAG, dispatches one subagent per target per wave (each subagent invokes a /arckit:* skill in its own context), validates outputs, commits the wave, and persists progress to .arckit/state.json for resumability."

# ArcKit Build Harness (v0.3)

You are running the ArcKit build harness. Your job is **orchestration only** — never read or write artefact content yourself. Spawn subagents for that.

## Operating principles

- **Never read or write artefact content in main context.** That's what subagents are for.
- **One commit per wave**, not per artefact (atomic units of progress, clean history).
- **Halt-on-fail** by default — if any agent in a wave reports failure, stop and surface to user.
- **State is sacred** — update `projects/{P}-{NAME}/.arckit/state.json` after every wave, before moving on.
- **Single message, multiple Agent calls** for parallelism within a wave. Never loop sequential Agent calls.
- **Idempotency**: if state says `complete` and the file exists at the recorded path, skip.

## Args

| Arg | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `<project>` | Project directory name or numeric ID (e.g. `001` or `001-arckit-saas`). If absent, prompt user. |
| `--plan` | Dry run. Print the wave plan, do not dispatch any Agents, exit. |
| `--resume` | Read state.json; continue from last incomplete wave. |
| `--target NAME` | Build only NAME and its missing dependencies. |
| `--refresh NAME` | Force-rebuild NAME and everything downstream. |
| `--no-commit` | Skip the per-wave git commit. |
| `--recipe NAME` | Recipe name (default `uk-saas`). Resolved against the precedence list below. |
| `--enable ID` | Enable an optional target (e.g. `--enable AIP`). |
| `--exclude ID` | Exclude a default-on optional target (e.g. `--exclude SVCASS`). |

## Recipe loading

Recipes are external YAML files. Lookup precedence for `--recipe NAME` (first hit wins):

1. **Project override**: `.arckit/recipes/{NAME}.yaml` — user customizations preserved across plugin updates
2. **Skill default**: `.claude/skills/arckit-build/recipes/{NAME}.yaml` — ships with this skill

Default recipe is `uk-saas`. To customize, copy the skill default to `.arckit/recipes/uk-saas.yaml` and edit there.

### Recipe schema (v1)

See `.claude/skills/arckit-build/recipes/uk-saas.yaml` for an annotated reference. Top-level keys:

- `recipe` — recipe name (string, must match filename stem)
- `schema_version` — recipe schema version (currently `1`)
- `description` — free text
- `defaults.version` — default version stamp for outputs (e.g. `"1.0"`)
- `optional_targets` — map of target ID → `{description, default}`
- `post_build_hooks` — list of `{skill, args}` to run after final wave (parallel)
- `targets` — list of target entries

Each `targets[]` entry:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `id` | yes | Unique target ID (e.g. `PRIN`, `ADR-001`, `DIAG-C4`) |
| `skill` | yes | ArcKit skill name (e.g. `arckit:requirements`) |
| `args` | yes | Args string passed to the skill, after substitution |
| `output.project` | yes | `"000-global"` or `"{P}-{NAME}"` |
| `output.type` | yes | ArcKit doc-type code (`PRIN`, `REQ`, `ADR`, `DIAG`, …) |
| `output.subfolder` | no | Relative subfolder; absent = project root |
| `output.multi_instance` | no | `true` requires `--next-num` on the helper |
| `topic` | no | Used in commit messages and `{TOPIC}` substitution |
| `deps` | yes | List of target IDs, may include glob `"ADR-*"` |

### Variable substitution

The orchestrator substitutes these placeholders in `args` and `output.project` before dispatching to workers (workers never see placeholders):

| Placeholder | Source |
|-------------|--------|
| `{P}` | Project ID, zero-padded (e.g. `"001"`) |
| `{NAME}` | Project slug (e.g. `"arckit-saas"`) |
| `{V}` | `defaults.version` from the recipe |
| `{TOPIC}` | `target.topic` (multi-instance ADR/DIAG topics) |

### Dep resolution

`deps: ["ADR-*"]` matches all targets whose ID begins with `ADR-`. Exact IDs take precedence; globs expand at wave-computation time against the resolved target list (after optional-target filtering).

## Wave plan algorithm

Standard topological sort with parallelism:

1. `pending = recipe.targets ∩ enabled - (state.complete ∩ files-exist)` — where `enabled` reflects `--enable`/`--exclude` flags and `optional_targets[id].default`.
2. `done = state.complete`
3. While pending non-empty:
   - `wave = { t ∈ pending : deps(t) ⊆ done }` (after expanding globs)
   - If wave empty → cycle / unresolvable. Halt with error, list involved targets.
   - Emit wave; remove its members from pending; (after dispatch + validate) add to done.

**Worked example** — for project 001 (UK-SaaS recipe) **starting from empty state**, the algorithm produces something like:

- W0: PRIN
- W1: GLOSSARY, REQ, STKE
- W2: ADR-001..ADR-008 (parallel)
- W3: STRATEGY, WARDLEY, RISK, HLD, DEVOPS, FINOPS
- W4: SOBC, TCOP, SBD, DPIA, DIAG-C4, DIAG-SEQ
- W5: DIAG-DEP, PLAN, OPS, AIP (if enabled)
- W6: ROADMAP
- W7: SVCASS
- W8: TRACE
- W9 (post-build): health, pages

Treat this as illustrative only; the harness recomputes waves at runtime from the recipe DAG.

## Per-wave execution

For each wave, in order:

### 1. Plan dispatch

Print:
```
Wave {N}/{total}: {targets joined}
  - estimated agents: {len(wave)}
  - estimated duration: ~2-5 min wall-clock per agent (parallel)
```

### 2. Single message, multiple Agent calls — all in parallel

Use the **Agent tool** with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. One Agent call per target. **All in the same assistant message** so they run in parallel.

Per-agent prompt template (substitute `{...}` placeholders from the resolved target):

```
You are an ArcKit artefact worker subagent (orchestrated by arckit-build, wave {WAVE_N}).

Project: {PROJECT_ID} ({PROJECT_NAME})
Target: {TARGET_ID}
Skill to invoke: {SKILL}
Skill args: {ARGS_RESOLVED}
Doc type: {TYPE}
Output project dir: {PROJECT_DIR}      # e.g. projects/001-arckit-saas
Output subfolder: {SUBFOLDER}          # e.g. decisions, or empty
Multi-instance: {MULTI_INSTANCE}       # true | false
Expected output path: {EXPECTED_PATH}  # for validation only

Inputs you may read (only these):
{INPUT_PATHS_BULLETED}

Steps:
1. Use the Skill tool to invoke `{SKILL}` with the args above verbatim.

   **Interactive Q&A handling (CRITICAL — subagents have no user available):**
   If the skill calls `AskUserQuestion`, you MUST select the option marked `(Recommended)`
   without asking. If no option is marked Recommended, use these defaults:

   | Question header | Default |
   |-----------------|---------|
   | Scope | `Full system` |
   | Consultation | `Surveys` |
   | Phase | value from skill args, else `alpha` |
   | AI mode / scope | derive from REQ FRs (AI-in-scope iff any FR mentions AI/ML/LLM) |
   | Risk appetite | `Medium` |
   | Anything else | first option in the list |

   Document the choice you made in your final report so the orchestrator can record it.
   Never block waiting for an answer.

2. Resolve the output filename via the ArcKit helper —
   **positional args first, flags last**:

   - Single-instance:
     ```
     ACTUAL_PATH="{PROJECT_DIR}/$(bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {PROJECT_ID} {TYPE} {VERSION} --filename)"
     ```
   - Multi-instance ({MULTI_INSTANCE}=true):
     ```
     ACTUAL_PATH="{PROJECT_DIR}/{SUBFOLDER}/$(bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {PROJECT_ID} {TYPE} {VERSION} --filename --next-num {PROJECT_DIR}/{SUBFOLDER})"
     ```

   Capture the resolved path into `ACTUAL_PATH`. The helper returns only the bare filename;
   the harness composes the full path. Do not hardcode.

3. Sanity check via Bash:
   - `test -f "$ACTUAL_PATH"` returns success
   - `[ "$(wc -l < "$ACTUAL_PATH")" -gt 100 ]`
   - `grep -c '^## Document Control\|^| Document ID' "$ACTUAL_PATH"` returns ≥ 1

4. Do NOT git commit. Do NOT modify other files. The orchestrator handles version control.

Report back ≤ 200 words:
- Actual file path written + exact line count
- Top 3 findings, scores, or RAG ratings (whatever the skill produces as headline result)
- Validation result: PASS or FAIL (with reason)
- Any failures, partial completions, or warnings
- AskUserQuestion choices made (if any)

Do NOT include the document content in your report. Just the summary.
```

### 3. Wait for all agents

When all return, collect summaries.

### 4. Validate

For each target in wave:
- File exists at expected path (`test -f`).
- Line count > 100 (`wc -l`).
- Document control header present (`grep -c '^## Document Control'` ≥ 1).

### 5. Update state.json

Read `projects/{P}-{NAME}/.arckit/state.json`, update each target with:

```json
{
  "<TARGET_ID>": {
    "status": "complete",
    "path": "{ACTUAL_PATH}",
    "built_at": "{ISO_TIMESTAMP}",
    "wave": {WAVE_N},
    "line_count": {LC},
    "skill": "{SKILL}",
    "topic": "{TOPIC_OR_NULL}",
    "agent_summary": "{≤200-word agent report}"
  }
}
```

For failures: `status: "failed"`, `error: "..."`, `wave: {WAVE_N}`.

### 6. Git commit

If `--no-commit` not set:
```bash
git add {OUTPUT_PATHS} projects/{P}-{NAME}/.arckit/state.json
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Build wave {N}: {targets joined} via arckit-build

{One-line per target with line count and headline result}

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### 7. Halt-on-fail

If any agent in the wave reported `FAIL` or validation failed:
- **DO write state.json** — record `status: "failed"`, `error: "..."`, `wave: {WAVE_N}` for failed targets, and `status: "complete"` for the targets in the wave that *did* succeed. State is needed for `--resume`.
- **Do NOT git commit** (don't half-commit a wave). Successfully-written artefacts are left in the working tree; they get bundled into the resume commit.
- Surface to user: per-target outcome, error summary, suggested remediation.
- Suggest `--resume` once fixed.
- Stop the build.

### 8. Move to next wave

Otherwise, proceed.

## State file shape

`projects/{P}-{NAME}/.arckit/state.json`:

```json
{
  "state_format_version": "0.3",
  "project_id": "001",
  "project_name": "001-arckit-saas",
  "recipe": "uk-saas",
  "recipe_path": ".claude/skills/arckit-build/recipes/uk-saas.yaml",
  "started_at": "2026-05-03T16:00:00Z",
  "last_wave_completed": 5,
  "current_wave": 6,
  "targets": {
    "PRIN":   {"status": "complete", "path": "projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-v1.0.md", "wave": 0, "source": "pre-existing"},
    "REQ":    {"status": "complete", "path": "...", "wave": 1, "source": "pre-existing"},
    "RISK":   {"status": "complete", "path": "...", "wave": 3, "skill": "arckit:risk"},
    "SVCASS": {"status": "pending"}
  },
  "waves": [
    {"n": 0, "targets": ["PRIN"], "status": "complete", "completed_at": "..."},
    {"n": 3, "targets": ["RISK", "STRATEGY"], "status": "complete", "completed_at": "..."}
  ]
}
```

## When invoked, perform these steps in order

1. **Parse arguments** from skill input (project, --plan, --resume, --recipe, --enable, --exclude, etc.). If project not specified, ask user.
2. **Detect project**: resolve `<project>` arg → `projects/{P}-{slug}/`. Confirm directory exists.
3. **Load recipe**: resolve `--recipe NAME` (default `uk-saas`) against the precedence list. Read the YAML with the Read tool. Validate top-level shape (`recipe`, `schema_version`, `targets`, `defaults.version`). Halt with a clear error if the recipe file is missing or malformed.
4. **Resolve enabled targets**: drop `optional_targets` whose `default: false` unless `--enable ID` was passed; drop `optional_targets` named in `--exclude ID`. Apply `{P}/{NAME}/{V}/{TOPIC}` substitution to every `args` and `output.project` field.
5. **Load state.json** at `projects/{P}-{NAME}/.arckit/state.json`. If absent, scan project dir for existing `ARC-{P}-*-v*.md` files and infer initial state.
6. **Subagent capability smoke-test** (first wave only, skip on `--resume`): before dispatching the real wave, spawn one throwaway `general-purpose` Agent with this prompt:

   > "Examine your system-reminder messages — they enumerate the skills available in this conversation. Return exactly one line:
   > - `AVAILABLE` if the list contains `arckit:principles` (or any other `arckit:*` skill).
   > - `NOT_AVAILABLE` otherwise.
   > Do NOT invoke any skill. Do NOT call any tool other than reading your own context."

   This is a metadata check, not a skill invocation — it should complete in seconds. If the response is `NOT_AVAILABLE`, halt: subagents in this session do not have access to plugin skills (Failure mode #1). Suggest enabling the plugin at user-scope or running the harness from a session where `claude --print '/skill list'` shows the `arckit:*` family.
7. **Compute work list**: enabled-targets minus `state.targets` whose `status: complete` AND file exists.
8. **If `--plan`**: print plan (each wave + targets + line `(skip|build) target ← deps`), exit.
9. **For each wave** (sequential outer loop):
   - Print wave header.
   - Build the per-agent prompt for each target in wave.
   - **Send a single assistant message containing N Agent tool calls** (one per target, all parallel).
   - Collect summaries when all complete.
   - Validate each output.
   - Update state.json (Write tool).
   - git commit (Bash) unless `--no-commit`.
   - Halt if any fail.
10. **Post-build hooks**: spawn parallel agents — one per `recipe.post_build_hooks[]` entry.
11. **Final report**:
    - Targets built (with line counts) / skipped / failed.
    - Total wall-clock.
    - Post-build hook outcomes.
    - Next recommended action (e.g., "review pre-GA blockers in TCOP §Critical Issues").

## Failure modes to watch for

- **Subagent doesn't have access to `arckit:*` skills** — detected by the smoke-test in step 6 of the run order; halts the build before any wave dispatches. Workaround if smoke-test fails: load the skill prompt in main context once, pass as plain text to agent (deferred to v0.4+).
- **Recipe file missing or malformed** — halt at step 3 with the exact YAML parse error and the precedence list of paths checked.
- **Skill expects interactive Q&A** — the worker prompt's defaults table covers this. The recipe's `args` field should be specific enough to skip interaction in the first place.
- **Output path collision** — two targets writing to same path. Recipe must have unique `(output.project, output.type, output.subfolder, multi_instance)` tuples for non-multi-instance targets, and unique `id`s for multi-instance ones.
- **State drift** — user manually deletes/edits artefacts after build. Detected via `test -f` validation + optional file-hash check (deferred to v0.4+).
- **Cycle in dependencies** — wave algorithm halts with "unresolvable cycle" error and lists the involved targets. Glob deps (`ADR-*`) are expanded before cycle detection.

## Future versions

- v0.4: file-hash-based change detection — skip if all inputs unchanged; orchestrator-side fallback for skills inaccessible to subagents.
- v0.5: cross-reference + schema validators between waves; recipe inheritance (`extends: uk-saas`).
- v0.6: CI mode (`--validate-only` for GitHub Actions).
- v1.0: skills declare I/O in frontmatter; harness reads frontmatter directly; dedicated `arckit:artefact-worker` subagent type; recipe "Expected output path" computed from skill metadata (single source of truth).
