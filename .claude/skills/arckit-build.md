description: "This skill should be used when the user asks to bulk-build ArcKit artefacts, run an end-to-end architecture build, generate multiple /arckit:* outputs in parallel, orchestrate a wave-based build, resume an interrupted build, or rebuild a project from scratch without exhausting main-context. Triggers: arckit-build, build harness, build all artefacts, generate full project, /arckit:* in parallel, run the recipe, --plan, --resume, --target, --refresh, --recipe, state.json. The skill orchestrates parallel /arckit:* generation using subagent isolation: reads project state, computes the artefact dependency DAG, dispatches one subagent per target per wave (each subagent invokes a /arckit:* skill in its own context), validates outputs, commits the wave, and persists progress to .arckit/state.json for resumability."

# ArcKit Build Harness (v0.2)

You are running the ArcKit build harness. Your job is **orchestration only** — never read or write artefact content yourself. Spawn subagents for that.

## Operating principles

- **Never read or write artefact content in main context.** That's what subagents are for.
- **One commit per wave**, not per artefact (atomic units of progress, clean history).
- **Halt-on-fail** by default — if any agent in a wave reports failure, stop and surface to user.
- **State is sacred** — update `projects/{P}/.arckit/state.json` after every wave, before moving on.
- **Single message, multiple Agent calls** for parallelism within a wave. Never loop sequential Agent calls.
- **Idempotency**: if state says `complete` and the file exists at the recorded path, skip.

## Args

| Arg | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `<project>` | Project directory name or numeric ID (e.g. `001` or `001-arckit-saas`). If absent, prompt user. |
| `--plan` | Dry run. Print the wave plan, do not dispatch any Agents, exit. |
| `--resume` | Read state.json; continue from last incomplete wave. |
| `--target NAME` | Build only NAME and its missing dependencies. |
| `--refresh NAME` | Force-rebuild NAME and everything downstream. |
| `--no-commit` | Skip the per-wave git commit. |
| `--recipe NAME` | Override recipe (default: auto-detect; UK-SaaS for now). |

## Recipe: UK-SaaS (v0.2, hardcoded)

Required artefacts. `{P}` = project ID, `{V}` = version (default `1.0`), `{N}` = sequence, `{NAME}` = project slug.

Output paths use `bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh` rather than hardcoded strings — the helper is the source of truth for ArcKit naming. Argument order is **positional**: `PROJECT_ID DOC_TYPE [VERSION]` followed by flags. Multi-instance types (ADR, DIAG, DFD, WARD, DMC, RSCH, AWRS, AZRS, GCRS, DSCT, WGAM, WCLM, WVCH, GOVR, GCSR, GLND) **require** `--next-num DIR` to allocate the sequence number.

```bash
# Single-instance (REQ, STKE, RISK, HLD, ...):
bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {P} {TYPE} {V} --filename
#   → ARC-{P}-{TYPE}-v{V}.md

# Multi-instance (ADR, DIAG, ...):
bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {P} {TYPE} {V} --filename \
  --next-num projects/{P}-{NAME}/{decisions|diagrams}
#   → ARC-{P}-{TYPE}-{NNN}-v{V}.md  (NNN auto-incremented)
```

The helper returns only the *filename* (e.g. `ARC-001-REQ-v1.0.md`), not the full path — the harness composes `projects/{P}-{NAME}/[subfolder/]{filename}` using the subfolder convention from the recipe table below. The "Expected output path" column is the result for validation only; the harness itself never hand-constructs these strings outside the helper + recipe-defined subfolder.

| Target | Skill | Skill args | Expected output path | Depends on |

| PRIN | `arckit:principles` | (none — global) | `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-v{V}.md` | — |

**ADR topic seeding** — `arckit:adr` requires a topic. Topics are recipe-defined, not auto-discovered (auto-discovery deferred to v0.5+ external recipes). UK-SaaS default ADR set:

| ADR | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| ADR-001 | Cloud platform (AWS / Azure / GCP) |
| ADR-002 | Identity & access (GOV.UK One Login vs Entra) |
| ADR-003 | Data residency & sovereignty |
| ADR-004 | AI / LLM provider (if AI feature in scope) |
| ADR-005 | Logging & observability stack |
| ADR-006 | Deployment topology (regions, multi-tenancy) |
| ADR-007 | Build vs buy (G-Cloud framework) |
| ADR-008 | Open-source licence policy |

To override, set `recipe.adrs[]` in a future external recipe file (v0.5+). For now, edit the table inline.

**Optional targets** (omit unless project flags them in scope):
- `AIP` — only if AI feature in scope (check REQ for AI-related FRs).
- `SVCASS` — only if public-service-style (always true for UK-SaaS recipe).
- `MOD-SBD` instead of `SBD` for sovereign / MOD recipes (separate recipe).

**Post-build hooks** (run after final wave):
- `arckit:health` — diagnostic scan.
- `arckit:pages` — regenerate docs site.

## Wave plan algorithm

Standard topological sort with parallelism:

1. `pending = recipe.targets - (state.complete ∩ files-exist)`
2. `done = state.complete`
3. While pending non-empty:
   - `wave = { t ∈ pending : deps(t) ⊆ done }`
   - If wave empty → cycle / unresolvable. Halt with error.
   - Emit wave; remove its members from pending; (after dispatch + validate) add to done.

**Worked example** — for project 001 (UK-SaaS) **starting from empty state**, the algorithm above produces this wave plan. Treat it as illustrative output; the harness recomputes waves at runtime from the recipe's dependency graph rather than reading this list.

- Wave 0: PRIN (no deps)
- Wave 1: GLOSSARY, REQ, STKE (deps on PRIN only)
- Wave 2: ADR-001..ADR-008 (parallel; deps on PRIN + REQ)
- Wave 3: STRATEGY, WARDLEY, RISK, HLD, DEVOPS, FINOPS (parallel)
- Wave 4: SOBC, TCOP, SBD, DPIA, DIAG-C4, DIAG-SEQ (parallel)
- Wave 5: DIAG-DEP, PLAN, OPS, AIP (parallel; AIP only if in scope) — note: DIAG-DEP and OPS have all deps satisfied by end of W3 and could topologically run in W4; deferred to W5 to keep wave widths balanced (W4 already has 6 targets)
- Wave 6: ROADMAP (deps on PLAN)
- Wave 7: SVCASS (deps on TCOP, SBD, DPIA, AIP)
- Wave 8: TRACE
- Wave 9 (post-build): health, pages

## Per-wave execution

For each wave, in order:

### 1. Plan dispatch

Print:
```
Wave {N}/{total}: {targets joined}
  - estimated agents: {len(wave)}
  - estimated duration: ~{2-5} min wall-clock per agent (parallel)
```

### 2. Single message, multiple Agent calls — all in parallel

Use the **Agent tool** with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. One Agent call per target. **All in the same assistant message** so they run in parallel.

Per-agent prompt template (substitute `{...}` placeholders):

```
You are an ArcKit artefact worker subagent (orchestrated by /arckit-build, wave {WAVE_N}).

Project: {PROJECT_ID} ({PROJECT_NAME})
Target: {TARGET_NAME}
Skill to invoke: {SKILL}
Skill args: {SKILL_ARGS}
Expected output path: {EXPECTED_OUTPUT_PATH}

Inputs you may read (only these):
{INPUT_PATHS_BULLETED}

Steps:
1. Use the Skill tool to invoke `{SKILL}` with the args above verbatim.

   **Interactive Q&A handling (CRITICAL — subagents have no user available):**
   If the skill calls `AskUserQuestion`, you MUST select the option marked `(Recommended)`
   without asking. If no option is marked Recommended, use these defaults:

   | Question header | Default |
   |-----------------|---------|
   | Scope | `Full system` |
   | Consultation | `Surveys` |
   | Phase | value from skill args, else `alpha` |
   | AI mode / scope | derive from REQ FRs (AI-in-scope iff any FR mentions AI/ML/LLM) |
   | Risk appetite | `Medium` |
   | Anything else | first option in the list |

   Document the choice you made in your final report so the orchestrator can record it.
   Never block waiting for an answer.

2. Follow the skill's instructions exactly. Resolve the output filename via the ArcKit helper —
   **positional args first, flags last**:
     - Single-instance: `ACTUAL_PATH="projects/{PROJECT_ID}-{NAME}/$(bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {PROJECT_ID} {TYPE} {VERSION} --filename)"`
     - Multi-instance (ADR/DIAG/...): `ACTUAL_PATH="projects/{PROJECT_ID}-{NAME}/{decisions|diagrams}/$(bash scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {PROJECT_ID} {TYPE} {VERSION} --filename --next-num projects/{PROJECT_ID}-{NAME}/{decisions|diagrams})"`

   Capture the resolved path into `ACTUAL_PATH` as shown. The helper returns only the bare
   filename; the harness composes the full path against the recipe-defined subfolder.
   Do not hardcode. The expected path above is for validation only.

3. Sanity check via Bash (note: pass `ACTUAL_PATH` set in step 2):
   - `test -f "$ACTUAL_PATH"` returns success
   - `[ "$(wc -l < "$ACTUAL_PATH")" -gt 100 ]`
   - `grep -c '^## Document Control\|^| Document ID' "$ACTUAL_PATH"` returns ≥ 1

4. Do NOT git commit. Do NOT modify other files. The orchestrator handles version control.

Report back ≤ 200 words:
- Actual file path written (resolved by the skill) + exact line count
- Top 3 findings, scores, or RAG ratings (whatever the skill produces as headline result)
- Validation result: PASS or FAIL (with reason)
- Any failures, partial completions, or warnings

Do NOT include the document content in your report. Just the summary.
```

### 3. Wait for all agents

When all return, collect summaries.

### 4. Validate

For each target in wave:
- File exists at expected path: `Bash test -f {OUTPUT_PATH}` returns success.
- Line count > 100: `wc -l < {OUTPUT_PATH}`.
- Document control header present: `grep -c '^## Document Control' {OUTPUT_PATH}` ≥ 1.

### 5. Update state.json

Read `projects/{P}/.arckit/state.json`, update each target with:

```json
{
  "<TARGET>": {
    "status": "complete",
    "path": "{OUTPUT_PATH}",
    "built_at": "{ISO_TIMESTAMP}",
    "wave": {WAVE_N},
    "line_count": {LC},
    "skill": "{SKILL}",
    "agent_summary": "{≤200-word agent report}"
  }
}
```

For failures: `status: "failed"`, `error: "..."`, `wave: {WAVE_N}`.

Write back to state.json.

### 6. Git commit

If `--no-commit` not set:
```bash
git add {OUTPUT_PATHS} projects/{P}/.arckit/state.json
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Build wave {N}: {targets joined} via /arckit-build

{One-line per target with line count and headline result}

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### 7. Halt-on-fail

If any agent in the wave reported `FAIL` or validation failed:
- **DO write state.json** — record `status: "failed"`, `error: "..."`, `wave: {WAVE_N}` for each failed target, and `status: "complete"` for the targets in the wave that *did* succeed. State is needed for `--resume` to work.
- **Do NOT git commit** (don't half-commit a wave). Successfully-written artefact files are left in the working tree; they will be picked up on `--resume` and committed with the rest of the (then-complete) wave.
- Surface to user: per-target outcome, error summary, suggested remediation.
- Suggest `--resume` once fixed.
- Stop the build.

### 8. Move to next wave

Otherwise, proceed.

## State file shape

`projects/{P}/.arckit/state.json`:

```json
{
  "state_format_version": "0.2",
  "project_id": "001",
  "project_name": "001-arckit-saas",
  "recipe": "uk-saas",
  "started_at": "2026-05-03T16:00:00Z",
  "last_wave_completed": 5,
  "current_wave": 6,
  "targets": {
    "PRIN":   {"status": "complete", "path": "projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-v2.0.md", "wave": 0, "source": "pre-existing"},
    "REQ":    {"status": "complete", "path": "...", "wave": 0, "source": "pre-existing"},
    "RISK":   {"status": "complete", "path": "...", "wave": 2, "skill": "arckit:risk"},
    "SVCASS": {"status": "pending"}
  },
  "waves": [
    {"n": 0, "targets": ["PRIN", "REQ", "STKE", "ADR-001..008"], "status": "complete", "completed_at": "...", "source": "pre-existing"},
    {"n": 2, "targets": ["RISK"], "status": "complete", "completed_at": "..."},
    {"n": 3, "targets": ["TCOP"], "status": "complete"}
  ]
}
```

## When invoked, perform these steps in order

1. **Parse arguments** from skill input (project, --plan, --resume, etc.). If project not specified, ask user.
2. **Detect project**: resolve `<project>` arg → `projects/{P}-{slug}/`. Confirm directory exists.
3. **Load state.json** at `projects/{P}/.arckit/state.json`. If absent, scan project dir for existing `ARC-{P}-*-v*.md` files and infer initial state.
4. **Subagent capability smoke-test** (first wave only, skip on `--resume`): before dispatching the real wave, spawn one throwaway `general-purpose` Agent with this prompt:

   > "Examine your system-reminder messages — they enumerate the skills available in this conversation. Return exactly one line:
   > - `AVAILABLE` if the list contains `arckit:principles` (or any other `arckit:*` skill).
   > - `NOT_AVAILABLE` otherwise.
   > Do NOT invoke any skill. Do NOT call any tool other than reading your own context."

   This is a metadata check, not a skill invocation — it should complete in seconds without loading any skill prompt. If the response is `NOT_AVAILABLE`, halt with a clear error: subagents in this session do not have access to plugin skills (Failure mode #1). Suggest enabling the plugin at user-scope or running the harness from a session where `claude --print '/skill list'` shows the `arckit:*` family.
5. **Compute work list**: recipe targets minus `state.targets` whose `status: complete` AND file exists.
6. **If `--plan`**: print plan (each wave + targets + line `(skip|build) target ← deps`), exit.
7. **For each wave** (sequential outer loop):
   - Print wave header.
   - Build the per-agent prompt for each target in wave.
   - **Send a single assistant message containing N Agent tool calls** (one per target, all parallel).
   - Collect summaries when all complete.
   - Validate each output.
   - Update state.json (Write tool).
   - git commit (Bash) unless `--no-commit`.
   - Halt if any fail.
8. **Post-build hooks**: spawn 2 parallel agents — one for `arckit:health`, one for `arckit:pages`.
9. **Final report**:
   - Targets built (with line counts) / skipped / failed.
   - Total wall-clock.
   - Health + pages outcome.
   - Next recommended action (e.g., "review pre-GA blockers in TCOP §Critical Issues").

## Failure modes to watch for

- **Subagent doesn't have access to `arckit:*` skills** — detected by the smoke-test in step 4 of the run order; halts the build before any wave dispatches. Workaround if smoke-test fails: load the skill prompt in main context once, pass as plain text to agent (deferred to v0.3+).
- **Skill expects interactive Q&A** — some skills (e.g., `/arckit:dpia`) ask AskUserQuestion. The agent prompt must pre-resolve those by spelling them out in `{SKILL_ARGS}`. The recipe's Skill-args column should be specific enough to skip interaction.
- **Output path collision** — two skills writing to same path. Recipe must have unique paths per target.
- **State drift** — user manually deletes/edits artefacts after build. Detect via `test -f` validation + optional file-hash check (v0.3+).
- **Cycle in dependencies** — wave algorithm halts with "unresolvable cycle" error and lists the involved targets.

## Future versions

- v0.3: full DAG resolver (currently waves are computed from the recipe but the algorithm runs against a hardcoded recipe table); input-hash-based change detection — skip if all inputs unchanged; hard-vs-soft dependency distinction (e.g., DPIA *can* read SBD if present without blocking on it).
- v0.4: cross-reference + schema validators between waves; orchestrator-side fallback for skills inaccessible to subagents.
- v0.5: external recipe YAML files (not hardcoded in skill); ADR topic auto-discovery.
- v0.6: CI mode (`--validate-only` for GitHub Actions).
- v1.0: skills declare I/O in frontmatter; harness reads frontmatter directly; dedicated `arckit:artefact-worker` subagent type; recipe-table "Expected output path" column dropped (validation invokes the helper directly — single source of truth).
